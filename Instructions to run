1) Please run an instance of mongodb on the local machine. Use the default port 27017. 
If you have mongodb running on any other port, Please configure it in line 18 in app.js. 

I made use of 'local' database since it is the default db. This can be changed too.

2) git clone https://github.com/naveengithub89/Wyzerr-Demo.git

   This creates a folder 'Wyzerr-Demo' in your machine.

   Enter the folder using the command  'cd Wyzerr-Demo'.

3) npm install

   This will install all the node dependencies.

4) node app.js

5) Open another terminal and enter the Wyzerr-Demo folder.

   cd Wyzerr-Demo

6) npm run dev

   This runs webpack and its dependencies including babel which transpiles all the jsx code.

7) Run localhost:3000 in the browser. This shoud get the app up and running.

8) Manage Movie List has the options to 'Add' and 'Delete' movies. The 'Wyzerr logo' and 'About Us' are just extra pages.
